All of us will meet together once a week to discuss what is our next step. This sucessfully helps us to keep our project continuously making progress. Like one week is cleaning data, one week is making hypothesis, one week is actually exploring data. And all of these steps, we accomplish the goals in time. All of us make an equal contributions. All of our members tries their best to absorb the knowledge in class. Also all of us is willing to learn new stuffs. Always learning things will be helpful for our project as well."

Nan values may not be occured completely at Random. Instead, it could be related to some other factors or other columns. Handling on this issue, our groupmembers held different opinions. Other issues we met are making conclusions between people's age and their suicide rate. We were not sure about how to do hypothesis test, so we searched on google. Overall, we solved many small issues we met and we are going well so far."

    "Our plan for successful completion of our COGS 108 project is to make contribution to our project every week and never delay our plan. And our next step is to do more data analysis. For example, we will make null hypothesis, and doing some test to test it. If we find the hypothesis is not doing well, we will first examine our thought to the data set. And if our thought is not working well, we will change our direction as soon as possible. And we are also reviewing content in the class. In this way, we can find some helpful method that will be beneficial to our project. What's more, except the content that we learned in class, we are also self-learning some method like ks-statistic, imputation, missingness that kind of things. Because some of the Nan value that we drop right now may cause our data be bias. So we are currently finding some better way to accomplish our project. We try to make our project have a relatively reliable result. And this is also the thing that we pursue."
