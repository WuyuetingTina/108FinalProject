    "What causes suicide in US? Specifically, we want to explore more on factors causing and predicting suicide. We would like to focus more on some factors, like age, states, gender and etc. And why and how these factors might influence suicide rate? More details will be shown in our hypothesis. We would like to analyze datasets and see other factors which might influence the likelihood of suicide. We would like to measure how variables like location, age, race, gender affect the likelihood of suicide."

The suicide rates in the US has gained more public attention with its recent spike (Reference 2). Previous studies has produced many useful statistics of suicide such as the geographical/ethinic/age/occupation distribution of suicide attempts (Reference 1).\n",

    "By intuition, we came up with certain factors that may share a correlation to the likelihood of suicides in the US.\n",
    "- Location of residency - crime rate, quietness, comfortability in the neighborhood is likely to have an affect on individual's psychological condition, thus the likelihood to suicide.\n",
    "- Age - Young age groups may experience more stress, while older age groups has less stress to push them to suicde. \n",
    "- Race - the act of suicides may be dishonorable to some culture, thus decreasing the likelihood of suicides for people from that group.\n",
    "- Gender - Females are more communicative thus better at coping with stress than men do, thus less likley to suicide."
